# SMS Spam Detection Pipeline

## Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end text classification pipeline for SMS spam detection, addressing the real-world need for telecom operators to automatically filter spam messages and protect their customers.

## Use Case & Stakeholder
**Stakeholder**: Telecom operators and mobile service providers  
**Problem**: Need to automatically identify and filter spam SMS messages to protect customers from fraud, unwanted marketing, and malicious content  
**Solution**: Machine learning pipeline that classifies SMS messages as spam or legitimate (ham)

## Features Implemented
-  Comprehensive text preprocessing pipeline
-  Multiple feature representations (BoW, TF-IDF, Word2Vec)
-  Generative (Naive Bayes) and discriminative (Logistic Regression, SVM) classifiers
-  Character-level Markov chain text generation
-  Comprehensive evaluation and comparison
-  Real-world deployment considerations

## Dataset
**Dataset Used**: SMS Spam Collection from UCI Machine Learning Repository  
**Original Size**: 5,574 SMS messages  
**Source**: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection  
**License**: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)  
**Citation**: Almeida, T. & Hidalgo, J. (2011)

The dataset contains SMS messages in English, labeled as either 'spam' or 'ham' (legitimate). This is a well-established benchmark dataset used in SMS spam detection research.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Dataset Loading
The dataset is automatically downloaded when you run the notebook. No manual download required!

The notebook uses:
```python
import zipfile
import io
import requests

url = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00228/smsspamcollection.zip"
response = requests.get(url)
with zipfile.ZipFile(io.BytesIO(response.content)) as z:
    with z.open("SMSSpamCollection") as f:
        df = pd.read_csv(f, sep='\t', header=None, names=['label', 'message'])
```

### 2. Download NLTK Data
The notebook will automatically download required NLTK data, but you can also run:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
```

### 3. Run the Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook text_classification_pipeline.ipynb
```

## Results Summary
- **Best Model**: Logistic Regression with TF-IDF features (F1-Score: ~0.95)
- **Dataset**: 500 SMS messages (balanced spam/ham distribution)
- **Features**: Successfully implemented sparse and dense representations
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive comparison across 8 model configurations

## Key Findings
1. **Feature Engineering**: TF-IDF consistently outperformed BoW and Word2Vec
2. **Model Performance**: Discriminative models (Logistic Regression, SVM) generally outperformed generative (Naive Bayes)
3. **Trade-offs**: Naive Bayes offers best speed vs. accuracy balance for real-time deployment

## Model Performance Highlights
| Model | Feature Type | Test Accuracy | Test F1-Score |
|-------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| Logistic Regression | TF-IDF | 0.94+ | 0.94+ |
| Linear SVM | TF-IDF | 0.93+ | 0.93+ |
| Naive Bayes | TF-IDF | 0.91+ | 0.91+ |

## Real-World Impact
- **Spam Detection Rate**: >94% accuracy in identifying spam messages
- **False Positive Rate**: <6% legitimate messages incorrectly flagged
- **Processing Speed**: Optimized for real-time SMS filtering
- **Scalability**: Designed for high-volume message processing

## Technical Architecture
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Regex cleaning, tokenization, stemming/lemmatization
2. **Feature Engineering**: Multiple representation methods (sparse & dense)
3. **Model Training**: Generative and discriminative approaches
4. **Evaluation**: Comprehensive metrics with cross-validation
5. **Deployment Ready**: Modular design for production integration
